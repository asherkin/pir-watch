Publishes messages to a Redis pub/sub channel when motion is detected by a GPIO-attached PIR sensor.

Compile:
  make

Requires a suitible C compiler, pkg-config, and the hiredis library to be installed.

Usage:
  ./pir-watch 1016 127.0.0.1 6379 sensors.motion.door 1

This publishes "1" to a pub/sub channel named "sensors.motion.door" on 127.0.0.1:6379 when GPIO pin 1016 is triggered.
The GPIO pin must be exported and setup as an input with rising edge detection before starting pir-watch.
